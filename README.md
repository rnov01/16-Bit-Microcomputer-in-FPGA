# Î¼FPGA

Implementation of a 16-bit microcomputer in VHDL for use in field-programmable-gate-array (FPGA)

The project began with an exploration of the "NAND to Tetris" course, with the final FPGA microcomputer being a loose adaptation of the "Hack" architecture

The completed "NAND to Tetris" project designs are included for reference

Project was implemented on CYCLONE V SOC FPGA [DE10-Standard Dev board from Terasic]
