Assembler takes in '.asm' assembly file as command line argument and returns '.hack' file containing binaries

Running program example:

	*python interpreter must be installed on pc*

	Place 'simple_assembler.py' and '.asm' file in same directory
	Navigate to that directory via the command prompt
	enter: Python simple_assembler.py my_file_name.asm
	'.hack' file is created with same name as input file and '.hack' extension
	If file already existed, program will prompt you to overwrite or select a new name
